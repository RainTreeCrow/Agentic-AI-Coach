# CV Review AI Coach

CV Review AI Coach is an AI-powered tool designed to help users optimize their resumes and match specific job requirements or general industry standards. This project is built using CrewAI, FastAPI and Docker and supports deployment on Google Cloud Run.

## Features

- **Resume Upload and Parsing**: Supports PDF and DOCX formats.
- **Comprehensive Resume Analysis**: Analyzes resumes across four key dimensions to provide scores, detailed feedback and actionable suggestions:  
  - **Structure**: Ensures the resume contains all key sections, such as Contact Information, Work Experience, Education, and Skills.
  - **Content Relevance**: Evaluates alignment with the provided job description, identifying relevant and missing skills. If no job description is provided, it compares the resume against typical industry standards.
  - **Language and Professionalism**: Checks grammatical correctness, readability, and tone, emphasizing formal and professional language.  
  - **Power Words**: Highlights strong action words and quantifiable achievements to maximize impact and persuasiveness.  
- **Detailed Feedback Reports**: Generates modular and comprehensive reports, with download options for individual dimension or the full report.
- **Web Interaction**: Simple front-end interface for file upload, job description text input (optional), feedback display and report download.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Runs in Docker containers and deploys to Google Cloud Run.

## Tech Stack

- **Core Components**: CrewAI Framework
  
    Powers the core functionality with a structured, modular approach using agents and tasks for resume analysis. This enables flexibility in defining analysis workflows and scalable processing.
  - *Agents*: Specialized components responsible for understanding the job description, analyzing various dimensions of the resume, and generating feedback.
  - *Tasks*: Modular units defining specific analysis operations, like Structure Analysis or Language Analysis, which agents execute.

- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Deployment**: Google Cloud Run

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RainTreeCrow/Agentic-AI-Coach.git
    cd community_submissions/cv_review_ai
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   
    Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.10 and Poetry installed. Then run:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. **Run the example script**:

    Run the pre-built main.py script to verify functionality. This example uses sample CV and job description files located in the ```test/data``` directory. Detailed agent logs will be displayed in the console.
    ```bash
    poetry run cv_reviewer
    ```

4. **Run the web application**:
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn src.cv_reviewer.app.api:app --reload
    ```
    Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

### Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t cv-reviewer .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 cv-reviewer
    ```

3. **Access the application**:
   
    Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

### Deploying to Google Cloud Run

1. **Submit the Docker build to Google Cloud Build and push to GCR**:
    ```bash
    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/cv-reviewer
    ```
    Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

2. **Deploy the container image to Cloud Run**:
    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy cv-reviewer \
        --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/cv-reviewer \
        --platform managed \
        --region YOUR_REGION \
        --allow-unauthenticated \
        --port 8000
    ```
    Replace YOUR_REGION with your desired region (e.g., europe-west2).

3. **Access your deployed application**:

    After the deployment completes, you will receive a service URL. Open the URL in your browser to access your application.

## Usage Instructions

Open the web interface.
1. Upload your resume (supports PDF or DOCX formats).
2. (Optional) Enter a job description to analyze relevance.
3. Click the Analyze button and wait for the analysis to complete.
