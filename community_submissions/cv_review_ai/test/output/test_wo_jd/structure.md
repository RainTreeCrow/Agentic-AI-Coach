Based on the CV of Harry Kidston, the analysis of the CV structure is as follows:

1. **Contact Information:** The CV includes a section for contact information, listing City, Country, Email Address, Phone, LinkedIn, and GitHub/Website. This section is complete and provides multiple ways for potential employers to reach the candidate.

2. **Work Experience:** The CV details two work experiences:
   - Software Engineering Internship at XYZ Tech, London, UK (June 2023 – Sept 2023), with responsibilities including collaboration with a multifunctional team, development of product features using C and C++, conducting code reviews, and participating in agile development processes.
   - Maths Tutoring at ABC Tutors, Bath, UK (Sept 2020 – June 2021), with responsibilities including providing group tutoring sessions, adapting teaching methods, and organizing lesson plans.
   
   The work experience section is detailed and provides a clear understanding of past roles and responsibilities.

3. **Education:** The CV includes relevant academic qualifications:
   - BSc (Hons) Computer Science from the University of Warwick, Coventry, UK (Sept 2021 – June 2024), with mention of a 2.1 achievement in Year 2, relevant modules, and a final year project.
   - Education from Bath Secondary School, Bath, UK (Sept 2014 – July 2021), with A Levels and GCSEs listed.
   
   The education section is complete and relevant to the candidate's desired industry.

4. **Skills:** The CV lists technical skills under the section "Technical Skills," including programming languages, web development, databases, software development tools, and operating systems. Non-technical skills, though not explicitly listed as such, are implied through experience descriptions, such as collaboration, communication, problem-solving, adaptability, time management, and leadership.

**Recommendations to Improve the Structure and Completeness of the CV:**
- **Skills Section:** Consider explicitly listing non-technical skills or soft skills to emphasize these competencies.
- **Projects Section:** Projects are well-detailed, but consider highlighting the impact or results of these projects where possible.
- **Interests Section:** The interests section is brief but relevant. Consider adding more details to showcase how these interests have developed relevant skills or experiences.

Overall, the CV is well-structured, with all critical sections present and organized logically. By emphasizing both technical and non-technical skills and providing more context or results for projects and interests, the CV can be further enhanced to stand out to recruiters.
