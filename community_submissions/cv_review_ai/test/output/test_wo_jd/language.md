My best complete final answer to the task is as follows:

**Language Quality Analysis of Harry Kidston's CV**

1. **Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar Errors**:
   - The word "SoÍ¢Åware" in the Experience section should be corrected to "Software."
   - In the Education section, "Eduction" should be corrected to "Education."
   - Consistent use of punctuation should be applied, such as adding periods at the end of bullet points for consistency throughout the CV.

2. **Casual or Inappropriate Tone and Suggestions for Professional Alternatives**:
   - The sentence "Collaborated with multifunctional team of engineers and designers to develop a new product" could be revised to "Collaborated with a cross-functional team of engineers and designers to develop a new product," which sounds more professional.

3. **Recommendations for Simplifying Complex Sentences or Improving Readability**:
   - The phrase "Conducted code reviews providing feedback to the team contributing to improving product reliability" can be simplified to "Conducted code reviews and provided feedback that contributed to improved product reliability."
   - Another example is "Participated in project planning meetings gaining understanding of agile development processes using Jira," which could be clarified as "Participated in project planning meetings to gain an understanding of agile development processes using Jira."

Overall, the CV demonstrates professionalism but could benefit from minor corrections in spelling and punctuation, as well as adjustments to maintain a consistent professional tone throughout. Simplifying certain complex sentences will improve readability and ensure clarity.
