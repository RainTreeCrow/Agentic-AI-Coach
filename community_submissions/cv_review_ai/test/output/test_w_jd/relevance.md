my best complete final answer to the task.

**Matched Skills:**

- **Programming Languages:** The CV demonstrates proficiency in Java and Kotlin, which aligns with the job's requirement for familiarity with C++, Java, Swift, or Kotlin.
- **Compiler and Programming Language Understanding:** While not explicitly mentioned, the candidate's education in Computer Science and experience in software engineering suggests a foundational understanding of programming principles, which could potentially cover compiler principles.
- **Version Management & Feature Tracking Software:** Experience with Git, GitHub, and Jira aligns with the requirement for modern version management and feature tracking software.
- **Collaboration:** The candidate has shown collaboration skills through teamwork in internships, hackathons, and project work.
- **Strong Academic Background:** Achieving a 2.1 in Year 2 of a BSc (Hons) Computer Science program and high grades in A Levels demonstrate a strong academic background.
- **Independent Projects:** The mobile game personal project shows evidence of independent activity and application of technical skills.

**Missing or Underrepresented Skills:**

- **Compiler Development and Optimizations:** The CV lacks specific experience or projects related to compiler development and high-level or low-level compiler optimizations.
- **Type Systems and Code Generation:** No specific mention or evidence of understanding of type systems and code generation.
- **Experience with Mainstream Compilers (LLVM or GCC):** There's no evidence of familiarity with LLVM or GCC, which are critical for the role.
- **Benchmarking Applications:** The CV doesn't mention experience with benchmarking applications across hardware platforms.
- **AI Frameworks:** The candidate's CV does not explicitly mention experience with AI frameworks, which is part of the technical requirements.
- **Soft Skills in Academia Collaboration:** While collaboration is mentioned, there is no specific evidence of collaboration with academia or transferring research to industrial applications.
- **Publications or Open Source Contributions:** The CV doesn't mention any publications or contributions to open source projects, which are desirable for demonstrating independent research and contribution to the field.

**Suggestions for Improving Alignment:**

1. **Highlight Relevant Coursework or Projects:** If the candidate has completed any coursework or projects related to compilers, AI frameworks, or benchmarking, these should be explicitly mentioned.
2. **Gain Practical Experience with Compilers:** Consider engaging in projects or internships that focus on compiler development and optimizations. Familiarity with LLVM or GCC would be particularly beneficial.
3. **Develop AI Framework Skills:** Gain experience with AI frameworks through projects or coursework, allowing for better alignment with job expectations.
4. **Engage in Open Source Contributions:** Participate in open source projects, especially those related to compilers or AI, to demonstrate independent initiative and industry engagement.
5. **Showcase Academic Collaborations:** If applicable, mention any collaboration with academic institutions or projects that involve transferring research to practical applications.
6. **Improve Benchmarking Skills:** Seek opportunities to work on projects that involve benchmarking applications across different hardware to gain practical experience in this area.

By addressing these gaps and enhancing the CV's content, the candidate can better align with the job description and improve their attractiveness to potential employers in the field.
