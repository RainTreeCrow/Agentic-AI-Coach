my best complete final answer to the task.

**Language Quality Analysis for Harry Kidston's CV:**

1. **Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar:**
   - "SoÍ¢Åware Engineering Internship" should be corrected to "Software Engineering Internship."
   - Ensure consistent use of periods at the end of bullet points, especially in the "Experience" and "Projects" sections.

2. **Casual or Inappropriate Tone:**
   - The phrase "Conducted code reviews providing feedback to the team contributing to improving product reliability" is slightly convoluted. Consider rephrasing to: "Conducted code reviews and provided feedback to enhance product reliability."
   - "Collaborated with project team to design and implement a full-stack e-commerce website" could be more professional as: "Collaborated with a project team to design and implement a full-stack e-commerce website."

3. **Recommendations for Simplifying Complex Sentences or Improving Readability:**
   - In the "Experience" section, the sentence "Assisted in development of new product features primarily using C and C++ meeting project milestones" could be simplified to: "Assisted in developing new product features using C and C++, ensuring project milestones were met."
   - The bullet point "Worked as part of a team during 24-hour hackathon to develop a solution for an environmental non-profit" can be improved for clarity: "Collaborated in a team during a 24-hour hackathon to develop a solution for an environmental non-profit."

By addressing these language issues, the CV will present a more professional and polished tone, improving readability and making a stronger impression on potential employers.
